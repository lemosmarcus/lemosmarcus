# Marcus Lemos
<sub>*Marketing analyst* at Embraer</sub>

Hi, I'm Marcus Lemos and I'm just getting started with this. For the last 14 years I've been working as a Social Communication and Marketing professional, being my last eight years as a Lieutenant for the Brazilian Air Force. There, I gathered some experience and background. 

Lately, I've been studying and am really interested in Data Science. I've always been into analitics, but for the first time I feel I can be in the front line of information and data, and not only be a consumer. No need to discuss how Marketing and Data Science are a perfect match. 

My credentials are towards Communication and Marketing, graduated in Public Relations, Advertising, Marketing and a Master Degree in Aerospace Science at the Air Force University (UNIFA).

Hopefully you'll soon see some nice insights and Data Science projects here. In the meanwhile, feel free to get in touch at marcus.vclemos@gmail.com
